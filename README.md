## Introduction
In this project, we'll answer some business questions by working with a modified version of a database. This database is called Chinook, and it contains information about a fictional digital music shop.

The Chinook database is eleven tables containing information about the artists, songs, and albums from the store, and also information on the shop's employees, customers, and the purchases.
